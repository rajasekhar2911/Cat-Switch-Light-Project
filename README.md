Cat Switch Light Project
This is a simple web page that simulates a light bulb switch and a cat image. The user can turn the switch "ON" or "OFF" using buttons,
which changes the status displayed and can trigger JavaScript functionality.

How It Works
When you press the "ON" button, the switch turns "ON" and can trigger an event (like changing the bulb or cat image).
When you press the "OFF" button, the switch turns "OFF".
